They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing.

12085	5	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."	3	2	3	3	3

Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had.

For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love.

It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.

12128	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.                                                                                                                                                    The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

12131	5	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3	3	3	3	2

Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.

That was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	3	3	3	2	2
12157	5	"Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life."	3	2	2	3	2
12158	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing.

12162	5	"The memoir reflects the memories and traditions created in a Cuban family home. The author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story. @CAPS1 uses words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to describe his family and house. @CAPS1 also creates a sense of pride in his parents and family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was always growing. His parents doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family. The author also mentions what his parents risked and sacraficed by going to the States. @CAPS1 is both proud and thankful of his parents. @CAPS1 says his parents, ""Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better. @CAPS1 is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done.As the author mentions all of this, the readers themselves @MONTH1 remember a bit of their childhood. Some @MONTH1 relate to the story completely while others laugh at certain parts that they too remember about their parents. In the end, the author's right, its the parents that turn this simple house into a loving home."	4	3	3	3	3
12163	5	"The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms.

That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1."	2	1	1	2	2
12168	5	"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong.

12178	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family.

In paragraph three and four, he tells how the environment he grew up in instilled that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He recalls past neighbors, and surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet.

He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. "	4	3	3	3	3
12213	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"".

Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career.

Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way."	3	2	3	3	2
12233	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	1	1	3	2
12235	5	"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."	3	2	2	3	2
12245	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."	1	1	1	2	2
12248	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2	2	2	2
12251	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3	3	4	4

An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had.

12529	5	"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir.

Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.

It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents.

When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.

There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them.

I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

13079	5	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."	4	4	4	4	4
13083	5	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times."	4	2	3	3	2
13086	5	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."	3	1	1	2	2
13093	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."	4	4	4	4	4

Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"".

The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States.

""Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company"	3	1	1	2	2
13461	5	"In this article, the authors mood seemed to be happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home."	3	2	1	2	2
13462	5	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir."	4	3	2	2	2
13464	5	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed. "	4	3	3	3	3
13466	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support."	2	1	2	2	2
13471	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	4	4	4	4

Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place.

13508	5	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home."	2	2	2	3	2
13511	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house.

When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy."	3	3	2	2	2

When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his cuban culture because that's what he was raised with. The overall mood he created was gratefulness."	3	3	3	3	3

Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family.

This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood.
