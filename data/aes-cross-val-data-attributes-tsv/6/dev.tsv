14849	6	"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose""."	3	3	2	2	2

14858	6	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law."	3	3	3	4	3
14859	6	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan."	2	2	2	4	3
14877	6	"The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea."	2	1	1	2	2

This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3.

Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. Lüsted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times."	3	2	2	3	2
14920	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible."	3	3	3	3	3
14930	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock.

14934	6	"In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was redesigning the building's original skeleton to fit the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to move too much that it became unsafe to use. The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with many obstacles while they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3	3	3	3
14943	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were alot of things that builders should have considered before attempting to allow dirigible to dock there"	3	2	2	2	2

14963	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3	4	4	4
14964	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most aparent problems was its a urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the street. They didnt want to dirigibles flying so close over with out not knowing wha's gunna happen. Another thing was that the German dirigible had been destroyed by fire. They had to think about how worse that could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and completely destroying the building. Also how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold a dirible. There were many problems they didn't think about in the process, that's why the mooring mast wasn't successful as planned."	2	1	1	1	1
14972	6	"The builders ran into quite a few problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle As stated in paragraph @NUM2 was nature ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. In addition the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3 ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"".

With all this weight being transmited to the buildings foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate its new situation This was verry expensive todo. Sixty thousand dollars wer nesciary.Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked The winds would toss it around.

14977	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	3	2	2	2	2
14978	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast.

(¶ @NUM1) this was a difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"" (¶ @NUM3), there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above New York City. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM4). The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in New York City. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" (¶ @NUM5) This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

14983	6	"The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with."	2	1	1	1	1

14986	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	2	2	3	3
14989	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure."	3	3	3	3	4
15000	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4	4	3	4
15004	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."	4	3	3	3	3
15005	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents.

The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast.

The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	3	4	4	4
15056	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles."	2	1	1	2	2
15063	6	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."	4	4	4	3	4
15069	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast."	4	3	3	3	3
15074	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3	3	2	2
15077	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	1	1	1	1
15086	6	"There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get. Plus, they also had to make sure the top was safe enough for the dirigibles to dock there without harming any people or the building."	2	0	0	0	0
15087	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles."	3	1	1	3	2
15097	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law. And don't forget what happens of the dirigible crashes in the area of New York City."	4	3	2	2	2
15100	6	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" It would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building."	3	2	2	3	2
15103	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast."	4	4	3	2	2
15112	6	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there was they had to build a higher taller building. They also had trouble building it so the workers had to back up the dates. Another obstacle that they had trouble with is the mast. ""The mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. The workers were also not planning on having these many obstacles they just wanted to do the job."	1	0	0	1	1

15124	6	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flamable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law.     As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" @CAPS1 how Flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area.     Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" @CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough.     Finally I said in paragraph @NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""     @CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above."	3	2	2	2	2
15147	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."	3	2	1	2	2
15150	6	"In the @DATE1's dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast."	3	1	2	3	3
15151	6	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws."	4	3	3	3	3
15153	6	"In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst."	2	1	1	1	1
15158	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles."	4	2	2	2	2
15161	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen."	4	3	3	3	3
15172	6	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face."	2	1	1	3	3
15191	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed."	3	2	2	3	2
15203	6	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."	4	3	2	2	2
15210	6	"In the excerpt the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing reality. For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas. Also they realized major would play a negative role. Wind would cause the @CAPS2 to swing around all Docked. They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a @ORGANIZATION1 population. Overall they began to realize saftey issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this."	3	2	2	2	2
15218	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.	2	1	1	2	1
15225	6	"Allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building, would leave architects faced with challenging sinerio's. Adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame. A single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (Lüsted. @NUM1) The frame of the Building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was Because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (Lüsted. @NUM2). This makes travel out side the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds. ""The winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents."" (Lüsted, @NUM3). This wasn't practical nor safe. These obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come."	4	2	2	2	2
15232	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast"	1	1	1	2	1
15239	6	"Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down.

Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem.

15251	6	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area.

The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.""

Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on.

Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable.

15278	6	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame.

Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable.	2	2	2	1	1
15284	6	"The mooring mast was a failure from the start.  The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most.  The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world.  Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp."	3	1	1	2	1

This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lifes.

Even though the building is the tallest building in New York. But it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents.         The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the like dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building.

The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.

As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal?

15349	6	"The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that"	3	2	2	2	2

Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas.

15360	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. Lüsted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law.

Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. "	2	1	1	2	1
15373	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""	4	4	4	3	4

They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely.

15379	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	2	2	2	2
15396	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	2	2	2	2

15451	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."	3	2	3	3	2
15455	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea."	3	3	2	3	3
15458	6	"The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers."	2	1	1	1	1
15460	6	"When constructing a mooring mast, @CAPS1 ran into many problems. Safety was the main problem/concern they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the @LOCATION1 were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in @CAPS1 feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful."	4	2	2	2	2
15461	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable.

15464	6	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe.

For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."	4	3	3	3	2
15471	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3	3	3	3

When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws.

In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality.

15523	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	3	3	3	3

15530	6	"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way."	4	3	3	3	4

This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year.

After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.

Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there.

However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building.

The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building.

15594	6	Based on excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles were that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	2	2	2	2
15618	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	3	2	2	2	1
15622	6	"When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled."	3	2	2	2	2
15626	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Saftey was the main focus because New York is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen.One problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame. This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling"	3	2	2	2	2

This law making it illegal for ship to even approach the area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could have been noticed before building."	3	2	2	2	2
15699	6	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."	4	3	3	3	3
15703	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?"	4	2	2	3	2
15705	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."	4	4	3	3	3
15712	6	"There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast."	4	2	2	2	2

""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	2	2	2	2
15716	6	"The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe."	2	1	1	2	1

For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly.

The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard.

The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem.

They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame.

For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles.In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future.

Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen."	3	3	2	2	2
15880	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3	3	3	3

This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it.

If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."	3	2	2	2	2

The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside.

They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets.

To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."	3	2	2	2	2
16025	6	"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. The mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon."	4	3	3	2	3
16027	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."	3	2	2	2	2
16036	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	3	2	2	2	2
16046	6	"Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety."	1	0	1	2	2
16048	6	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers."	1	0	0	1	1
16051	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas."	4	3	2	2	2
16056	6	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful."	3	3	2	2	2
16066	6	"The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people."	3	2	2	2	2
16069	6	"The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have poped it. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. Especially in a crowded area such as New York."	2	1	1	1	1
16070	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent.

16073	6	"After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly."	3	2	2	2	3
16088	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast."	3	3	3	3	3
16089	6	"Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of the non-U.S dirigibles docking. The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted they both experienced first hand the dangers of it."	3	3	2	2	2
16092	6	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."	4	3	3	3	3
16109	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	3	4	4	3	3
16111	6	"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	1	1	2	1
16112	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2	2	2	2
16114	6	"While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden."	1	0	1	1	1
16122	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with.

16128	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1."	4	3	3	2	2
16129	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields with the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was nether practical nor safe. The builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles."	3	2	2	2	1
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	2	2	3	3
16134	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	2	2	2	2
16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3	2	2	2

Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame.""

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM3).

16158	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	2	2	2	3
16160	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived."	4	3	3	2	3
16161	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building."	4	4	3	3	3
16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	2	2	2	3

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

16173	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end.

The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking.

These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	4	3	3	3	3

For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down.

In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.

After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.

16390	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."	4	4	3	3	4

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low.

The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks.

Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents.

This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public.

They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building."	4	4	4	3	4

The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg.

Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land.

The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s.

An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth.

16503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	3	3	3	3
16511	6	"The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below. And since they had to do that The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation"	2	1	1	2	2
16512	6	"Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below."	2	0	1	1	1
16513	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. One obsticle the builders faced was that they had to modify the buildings framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure wood have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below."" That was another obsticle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obsticle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The idea was neither practicle nor safe."	3	2	2	2	2
16515	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building the architects had to take the height.. of the building and mooring mast into account. They simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof. Also the wind currents over one thousand feet high our rapidly changing. An extremely large dirigible board at the top of the building would ""add stress to the buildings frame"". (@NUM1) The architects would have to modify and strengthen its steel frame for the safety of the building. These changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars. But alas, the mooring mast of the empire state building never fufilled its destiny due to these obstacles."	3	1	1	2	2
16523	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come @CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. Finally the fear of the blimp going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash.	3	2	2	2	2
16525	6	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing it's gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles."	3	2	2	3	2
16532	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, and the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition a law for bid @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles."	4	2	2	2	2
16537	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	1	1	3	3
16542	6	"A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields."	3	2	3	3	3
16551	6	"The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved."	4	3	3	3	3
16566	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	4	3	2	2	3
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	3	2	3	3
16571	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	1	1	1	1
16573	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2	2	3	3
16574	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles @CAPS2 using highly Flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal."	3	3	3	3	3
16578	6	"In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building."	2	2	2	3	1
16581	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast."	4	4	4	4	4
16586	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3	2	3	3

The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2	2	3	3

Some dirigible were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was to dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell...."" The last obstacle was the law.

16625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York."	2	2	2	3	2

Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it.
