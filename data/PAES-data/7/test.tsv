If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back.

17965	7	"In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you don�t be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didn�t get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life."	6	6		12				1	2	1	2			1	1	2	2

You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride�s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn�t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed.

After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked “how long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?” “about five minutes.” @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. “how long?” “six now.” @CAPS3 wouldn’t have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. “The performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.” @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over.

We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers �I�m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up.� @CAPS1!? �@CAPS2 long will it take?� asked my mom.� About five hours, �she said.

Since they�re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it�s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn�t want to get rid of them, but we had to.

Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn�t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad�s dream come true.

18720	7	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don�t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don�t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don�t think if I didn�t have any patients I wouldn�t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don�t have and they get bad grades and everything.	5	5		10				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	2

Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy."	10	11		21				2	3	2	3			2	3	3	3

When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn�t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I�m still alive, right? My friends don�t know me to have patience and I don�t either.

The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you don�t just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait."	6	4		10				0	2	2	2			0	1	2	1

As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child.

Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

17986	7	"Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid of. It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted.

19302	7	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I�m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.	7	4		11				0	2	2	3			0	1	1	2

18326	7	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them."	6	5		11				1	1	2	2			0	1	2	2								
19183	7	"I�m writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like I�m waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they can�t so even though she�s getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class."	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			0	2	2	2								
19044	7	Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that�s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that�s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don�t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn�t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.	4	3		7				0	1	2	1			0	1	1	1

Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening.

18690	7	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.	6	5		11				0	2	2	2			0	1	1	3

When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor.

18741	7	"Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can�t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn�t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it�s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt.

I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else."	8	9		17				1	2	2	3			2	2	2	3

For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying �hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	2	1	1

And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesn�t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great.

18626	7	"�Patience is a virtue.� You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here�s a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, I�m going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it�s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1� services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I can�t deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pro�s and con�s of having patience thank you for reading my essay."	7	7		14				0	2	2	3			0	2	2	3

Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn�t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen.

Those people find it easy to wait even when it�s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. �@CAPS1 @CAPS2� the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn�t back yet I didn�t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4�d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn�t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. �@CAPS3!� I shouted, �I don�t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop� I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  �@NUM1 minets till midnight� @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me �That�s impossible� I told her. �You can make it.� @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn�t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. �@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen� how is it going to end� @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. �@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad� @CAPS10 asked. �I guess not� I answerd sheepishly. �Being patient payed off� @CAPS10 lectured. I didn�t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier.

Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food.

Well, now I wasn�t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn�t hate the idea but I didn�t love it either. Of course. It didn�t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn�t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I�ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year.

It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. �@CAPS1� I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic �try again�, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn�t stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it!

There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For �bragging rigts,�we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn�t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it�s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn�t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, �can you do it?�I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!"	10	12		22				3	2	3	2			3	3	3	3

Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something.

These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

18294	7	"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you�re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you�re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren�t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you�ve lost, and you�ve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I�ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I�m trying to say is that when you�re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn�t a �bundle of roses� all the time, so soon or later, you�re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn�t human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I�m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently."	9	7		16				0	3	3	3			0	2	2	3

My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don�t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it�s implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
18030	7	"I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months �old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when �her baby,� @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it."	10	11		21				3	2	2	3			3	3	2	3

People always say �Patience is vertile.� @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o�clock, he will be there by seven o�clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o�clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and �Patience.�"	6	7		13				1	1	2	2			0	2	2	3

But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned �are we there yet?�� �no.�� said @PERSON1 �were lost� �oh�  I replyed. But I really didn�t think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the sun�s  raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags!

17938	7	"Patience is important in life. Something when you don�t have patience things tend to go wrong and that�s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don�t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn�t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn�t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn�t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn�t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn�t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn�t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn�t have patience. But if they did that wouldn�t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	1	1	2

The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table.

Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it.

When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop �the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars."	12	9		21				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	3

I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition.

After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place.

17868	7	"Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn�t know why she didn�t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream �@CAPS3! @CAPS3!� but it didn�t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn�t hear her. @PERSON1 isn�t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn�t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don�t know if they�ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I�ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad."	8	7		15				2	2	2	2			2	1	2	2

For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking.

I have a lot of friends because I�m outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I�m outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment.

Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out.

His hands got all sweaty and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He screamed. The resses ladies brought him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up. They picked me up and then got my bother. We drove to the hospital and they did x-rays. It took forever.

18904	7	"Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you �don�t have the time� to do something then you don�t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn�t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn�t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as �@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.� @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now"	8	6		14				1	1	3	3			0	2	2	2

He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didn�t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, �@CAPS1 do you want!� @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great.

18678	7	"The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don�t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don�t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don�t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don�t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn�t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that�s a sign of patients.

The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn�t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss.

Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around.

I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. "@CAPS2!" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. "@CAPS3 happened?" "I tried my back flip."  "I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!"  "@CAPS4…" "I'll go get an ice pack." @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle.

Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you�re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, �@CAPS2, don�t do it again.� @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don�t make those mistakes again.

Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.	8	4		12				2	2	2	2			0	1	1	2

Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?� �I�ll try�. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said �@CAPS4 you for your patients�. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie.

One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don�t give up because it will turn out alright in the end.

First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t @NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset.

Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second patients is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience.

I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it.

19266	7	"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I�m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I�m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don�t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn�t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself �be patient� over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn�t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me �@CAPS2!� @CAPS3 wouldn�t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That�s a time I�ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That�s how I was patient, and I�m glad I was patient with my legs. I�m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people can�t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy.

My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves.

Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load.

19140	7	"Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just don�t have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn�t know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, �@CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him?� then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we won�t talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasn�t patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldn�t tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that we�re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people can�t have patience when they want to become friends."	8	12		20				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."	8	12		20				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don�t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn�t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn�t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4�s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I �m daddy�s little girl? I think you could�ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble.

Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should�ve realized I wouldn�t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I�d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn�t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That�s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him."	9	8		17				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2								
18164	7	Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesn�t want to be at home because he mom don�t let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.	11	8		19				3	3	2	3			2	2	2	2

My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

18941	7	"I�m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago� I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don�t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to�uh, I think it�s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don�t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It�s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can�t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a �sniff�, �sniff�, �sniff�� �sniff�, �snot. We�re not aloud to get up, so we�re stuck �sniff�, �sniff�, snot�-ing  all hour long. When you we�re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it�s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that�s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don�t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this� writing about patience, but now, I�m done. (yes!)"	8	11		19				1	1	3	3			2	3	3	3

It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said," @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball." I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked." "@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said "@CAPS3!" "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise," @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls." You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more," he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2." @CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?"I asked "@CAPS6 day!" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man.

But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words �practice makes perfect� she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.	8	11		19				2	2	2	2			3	3	2	3

19386	7	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!	10	12		22				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	3

Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn�t want to wait for the ride anymore.

17930	7	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn�t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn�t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That�s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.	9	12		21				2	2	2	3			3	3	3	3

19261	7	"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don�t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don�t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients!

Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that�s why. The morning probably wasn�t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor�s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window.

Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine.

At gym, she didn�t grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldn�t be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom.

Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order.

So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don�t want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. �hey mom when are we having the family party?� �@DATE2.� @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isn�t patient then I dont know @CAPS1.

17976	7	"Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn�t just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	1	1	2

I could not wait any longer to go to this game!�@CAPS1 your patience!�my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day.

I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandma�s cottage I didn�t complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient don�t go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me.

Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it�s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren�t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2."	6	5		11				0	2	2	2			1	1	1	2

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!

I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.

Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can�t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don�t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you.

I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him.

19061	7	"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get�s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you�ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can�t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don�t hurt their feelings if they can�t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don�t get in trouble. If you wouldn�t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That�s why you need patience."	8	7		15				0	2	3	3			0	2	2	3

Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn�t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present.

I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it�s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan�t get things done. Most of my family and I don�t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."	6	12		18				1	1	2	2			3	3	3	3

I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they�re holding you up, but it�s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don�t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don�t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you�ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S.

I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs.

18517	7	"As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I�m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don�t care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don�t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don�t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help."	8	6		14				2	2	2	2			1	1	2	2

Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, �turn! Turn!� but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. �@CAPS1�s okay. You almost had @CAPS1!� mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up.

When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day.

18134	7	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don�t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don�t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should�nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don�t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.	7	5		12				1	2	2	2			0	1	2	2

Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm.

I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons.

She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she�s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they�re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I�d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a �war.� I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor.

But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes.

Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn�t care because it was my friend�s and my favorite ride, it wasn�t so bad because it�s all worth it when you ride the ride.

Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you�d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an �epicfail�. But I still live. Playing the piece isn�t so bad, it�s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don�t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I�m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care.

There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn�t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I�m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."	12	7		19				3	3	3	3			0	2	2	3

I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didn�t blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldn�t have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @CAPS4 that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were  getting on the plane.

So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on fun slide. The blason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flight or stair�s with in ??? So the second time  I went up I ran up the stair�s so I could be the first one, so I did and  I still had to wait because it still people there from last time. So I waited my turn.

I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn�t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport.

19123	7	"If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1�s @CAPS1, that�s a different story. I�ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1�s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn�t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn�t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn�t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1�s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts.

I�m going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry in get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinging about how should I be patient, �@CAPS1 I said� to myself I have to take the time @CAPS1 I could reach a good grade and @CAPS1 I was patient.

18284	7	"Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3								
18253	7	"Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well I�m going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking. @PERSON1 is a very patience person."	8	4		12				1	3	2	2			0	1	1	2								
18823	7	Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			2	2	1	2

18726	7	"Being patient is important, as I�ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn�t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1�s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend�s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn�t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards."	12	8		20				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	2

18521	7	Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would�ve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right.

So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don�t have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect.

I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn�t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don�t think that I�ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, �Patience is a virtue.�"	9	8		17				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2

While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait.

My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

My dad yelled, �it�s time to go, @CAPS1!� I replied �okay!� I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom�s car.

It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas.

They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park.

19366	7	"Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; �you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.� @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn�t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn�t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn�t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn�t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn�t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!"	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3								
19026	7	"Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!"	9	12		21				2	2	2	3			3	3	3	3								
19470	7	"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it�s distracting. Now that you�ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let�s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"	9	6		15				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	2								
19085	7	"I�m always having to be patient. It�s because I have an older brother that doesn�t do what he is told. Let�s say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then I have to go when he�s cleaning and he won�t let me. So I�m that�s one of the reasons. Another is my older sister she�s always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. So I wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, that�s why I�m very patient."	5	5		10				1	1	1	2			0	1	2	2

She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

19145	7	"Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin�s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they�re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly.

I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it�s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we�re going somewhere special, or I�m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It�s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can�t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I�m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I�m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn�t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don�t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don�t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren�t always patient either.

As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I haven�@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didn�@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad don�@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn�t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I�ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That�s a time where I was patient.	9	8		17				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2

At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes."	9	9		18				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3

18243	7	"During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn�t know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn�t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn�t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don�t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes won�t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I�m not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn�t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didn�t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn�t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would�ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I�m amazed at my mom�s understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

17899	7	"�@CAPS1! Look out!� @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here�s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It�s unbearable to watch. Ambulences� sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that�s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I�d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5�d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn�t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I�d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it�s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn�t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren�t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. �@CAPS4�, @CAPS5 starts, �I know I haven�t been patient with you lately, and for that I�m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.� I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, �I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?� @CAPS5 didn�t have to explain any farther. �@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,� my voice caught in my throat, �just to get my stupid notebook.� A single tear weaved its way down my face. �@CAPS7, hunny!� my mother teared up as @CAPS6. �That doesn�t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!� I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. �@CAPS8,� I said, regaining composure, �that�s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.� @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother�s lips. �I will wait then.� And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient we�ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I did�nt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldn�t wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience.

17860	7	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn�t say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didn�t go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children� I don�t like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are �guardian parents� they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
18713	7	"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn�t even know that means, but if I�m patient I�ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."	8	4		12				0	3	3	2			0	1	1	2

I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes you�ll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me �I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill.

If you don�t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn�t want to wait so she didn�t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn�t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that�s what happens when you don�t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that�s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you.
