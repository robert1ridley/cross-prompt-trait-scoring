14983	6	"The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with."	2	2		2																					
14989	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure."	2	3		3

15612	6	"New technology, especially in aviation,requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix."	2	2		2																					
15099	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium make them lighter than air."" The first problem is that it's material could be broken if happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there, the theory did not work out in reality."	3	3		3																					
15361	6	"The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical."	3	3		3																					
15557	6	"When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law."	3	3		3																					
16444	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building.  The thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building.  They would have to ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  The builders had to make over @MONEY1 worth of modifications.  Another reason was nature.  As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"".  The dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians.  A final obstacle was an already existing law.  The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  These obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose."	3	3		3																					
16066	6	"The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people."	2	3		3																					
16052	6	"The problems that were faced was that the ships could get blown by the wind a hit buildings. Than they thought of putting weighos on the shp, but than they could fall off and hit people on the ground."	1	1		1																					
15275	6	"Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical. Those are obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
16046	6	"Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety."	1	1		1																					
15931	6	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose."	2	3		2																					
15546	6	"The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15224	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area.Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it."	2	2		2																					
15416	6	"A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the empire state building didn't seem so @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public."	4	4		4																					
15672	6	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.	1	2		2																					
14890	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true."	2	3		3																					
15540	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
15108	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstical was that it lacked safty. Dirigibles are highly flammable machiens when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York City would be tragic..  Another obstical that the Mooring Mast faced was @CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with a electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the winds of @ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles would ""swivel around & around the mask"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) this would cause tension to build on the buildings frame and lead to a very unsafe inviorment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated that it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safty reasons leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable."	3	3		3																					
16611	6	"After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects want to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, ad after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 up in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16005	6	"In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. The builders should have relized all the hazards. They were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the moorning mast for dirigibles and their passengers."	3	2		3																					
15293	6	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the obstacles faced was that putting a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. This made the builders have to modify the frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flamable."" This would put great danger to the people of New York. That was a huge problem the builders faced. The builders at the Empire state Building faced many obstacles but safety and reconstruction were just some of those problems."	2	2		2																					
15568	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
15335	6	"There were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Those are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
15088	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock."	3	3		3																					
15213	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable.

16577	6	"In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1."	3	4		4																					
16324	6	"The builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played as a big obsticle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building."	3	2		3

Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.

16465	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, the dangers of allowing dirigibles that were made outside of the United States. May non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible L�sted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were to wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were thethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon L�sted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigibles on the Empire State Building illegal."	3	3		3																					
15321	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public."	4	4		4																					
15656	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced alot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to let allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before @CAPS1 they didnt know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first Al smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things werent that easy. They faced complications with the @ORGANIZATION1 with there research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was @CAPS1 high up in the air, and there was alot of practicing involved. Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain."	3	3		3																					
15172	6	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"".

15211	6	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders and encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age."	2	2		2																					
15767	6	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4		4

The owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".The second major obstacle was nature; ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand-foot dirigible moored atop the building would add enormous stress to the frame of the building.In the end these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the air plane taking over modern travel the dirigible and the mooring mast were doomed."	2	3		3																					
16512	6	"Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below."	1	2		2																					
16245	6	"Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, @CAPS1 that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather.Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also @CAPS1 forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Piolets were worried the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in danger. Many obstacles hindered the loading dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
14845	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. @NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra @MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. @NUM2 was in December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future."	4	4		4																					
15442	6	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."	2	4		2																					
15062	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1) and posed a threat to not only the passengers, but the people at the docking station as well. Another potential obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was dangerous; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2). A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State building was not a safe or practical one."	4	3		4																					
15611	6	"The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project."	3	4		4

The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable.

The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to.

The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down.

Also, the wind would be an obstacle as well. It would cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast.

The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.""

Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.""

Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	4		4																					
16415	6	"Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building."	4	4		4																					
15958	6	"In paragraph 6 it said ""New York City was the lack of a suitable Landing space"" Another obstanke in paragraph @NUM1 was the Nature it self the winds was push the dirigible around in the back of it. The other obstakle was in paragraph @NUM2 the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the problem that the Empire builders faced"	2	2		2																					
16164	6	"During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information."	2	1		2																					
15779	6	"There were Several obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of sefty. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
15176	6	"There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared."	3	4		4																					
16496	6	"Marcia Amidon L�sted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3																					
16315	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: @CAPS1 they choose dirigible instead of balloon, because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter.

16364	6	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They had to find a way to keep the dirigibles from spining around the top of the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant the dirigibles, would swivel around the mast unless tied down. The next problem or obstacle was making the buildings structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The next challenge was to create a safe enviroment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city was already made below. The drigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Clearly the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	3	3		3																					
16527	6	"Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a great accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think of the hazards and for ""reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would be an immense danger to the densely populated city.Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting and the backs of dirigibles would swing around and around.There was also a law against low flying aircraft over urban areas. so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early @CAPS2 of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock."	4	3		4																					
14941	6	"There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality."	3	2		3

16546	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15133	6	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. According to the excerpt the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. Also having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of The building. In order to maintain the dirigible in place it would cost them money. Quoating the article, ""The stress of The The The dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.""

This meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed @NUM1 dollars. Next, it proved to dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumputous sky-scraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, ""the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers try to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower."	4	4		4

14923	6	"In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3

This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used.

This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area.

In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."	4	3		4																					
15419	6	"Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be to unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City.Another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. This was the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building.The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles."	3	3		4

In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."	2	3		3

If a DiriGiBle was to be teathered at the top by only one rope in the front the back of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building.

14840	6	The builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final peice that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.	2	3		3																					
15565	6	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the @DATE1's dirigibles were a big thing in transportation. The problem was that there wasn't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State building down.	3	2		3																					
15294	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work."	2	3		3																					
16487	6	"Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put to much pressure on the building frame, another was the baloon it's self, besides the U.S. most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to fly/hold or dock a air craft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State building brought many issues and delemas making it hard to carry out such a idea for such a tall building."	3	3		3																					
16589	6	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.	1	1		1																					
15991	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen steel frame of the Empire State building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the @DATE1's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself. violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe."	2	3		3																					
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
16551	6	"The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved."	4	4		4																					
15778	6	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose. For reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed. And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.	1	1		1																					
15851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area.

A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings."	3	3		3

A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady.

16538	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe."	3	3		3																					
15132	6	"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph @NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end."	3	3		3

15678	6	The builders had to face alot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldent just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State.

However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...

Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.""

While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4		4

The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around.

It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights.

Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether.

One obstacle that was faced was the buildings foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below.

This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building."	1	1		1

Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians.

Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."	3	3		3

The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas.

15450	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building.

The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety.

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash.

This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal."	4	3		4

Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flamable hydrogen rather than helium.

An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

(paragraph @NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework.Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration."	3	3		3																					
14861	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose."	3	3		3																					
16380	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking."	2	2		2																					
15396	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3

The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make.

Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.'

There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it.

Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.

The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast.

Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City.

Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast."	1	1		1																					
15250	6	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
15339	6	"Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
16296	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted some obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead of helium which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a cord attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be ""dangling high above pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) This would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so strong that it could throw it into a building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""

After that another dirigible the @CAPS1 year blimp Columbia, attempted a Publicity stunt where it would fly up and deliver a bundle of news papers to the Empire State Building. when the stunt wan't success the blimp could be use for transportation in the Future."	1	1		1																					
16149	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first issue faced was that ""most of dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was an issue because if the dirigible would catch fire or explode over it highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making it impossible to board. This would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock."	4	4		4																					
14950	6	"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose."	3	3		3																					
15227	6	"And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition."	3	3		3																					
15837	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly."	1	1		1																					
15943	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building. The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. 	3	3		3																					
15153	6	"In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst."	2	2		2																					
16160	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived."	4	3		4																					
15585	6	"Based ON this excerpt the builders faced A few problems when building the Empire State Building. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelin's or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at @NUM1 ft in the Air. Another problem the buiders faced with saftey. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was A fire saftey issue.

15028	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, there. They had known that the mooring mast wasn't perfect. There were many reasons but the greatest one they said was the safety. The hydrogen in them is highly flammable and after the accident in New Jersey in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened right in New York. So they dropped the idea later on and left the transportation to the airplanes."	1	2		2																					
15651	6	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the @CAPS1. S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the @CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. Dirigibles is an old word for Blimps. The obstacle the @CAPS1.S.B. had to over come were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay @MONEY1 in modifications on the @CAPS1.S.B. for the framework. The second was nature, the winds would make the back of the Dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. Last but not least the law, the dirigibles cant be as low as the @CAPS1.S.B. because its too low and they cant fly low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15043	6	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. First obstacle was designing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some dirigibles were unsafe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L�sted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (L�sted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (L�sted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was it unsafe or impractical, it was illegal."	3	3		3																					
16354	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in @LOCATION1 would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	3		3																					
15065	6	"In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles."	3	3		3

There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start."	3	3		3																					
16124	6	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."	4	4		4																					
16222	6	"When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into @NUM1 dock for limps proved to be unrealistic.The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps."	3	3		3																					
15167	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas."	3	3		3

The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering.          The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apprently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fears, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the baloon without the risk of the falling on civilians.

With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up.

It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land.

Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch.

Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below.

Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the buildings skeleton in order for it to work. This they did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen. This makes them highly flamable. With others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians.

Al Smith, former governor of new york, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was @CAPS2 the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the Public. Thus, the mast was never used."	3	3		3																					
15910	6	"In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

Builders fix this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed.

The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it.

If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens.

Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible.

15882	6	"The Empire State Building was meant to be great The tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles."	3	2		2																					
15151	6	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws."	4	4		4																					
15111	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws. ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural."	3	3		3																					
15873	6	"While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen."	3	3		3																					
15299	6	"In the building of @ORGANIZATION1 gets very competitive. He wants to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction."	0	1		1																					
15375	6	"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safetly. According to the reading, it says that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe.       Last but not @CAPS1, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefor it would be impossible for a ship to land there."	4	3		4																					
14967	6	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished."	4	3		4																					
15666	6	"During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders @CAPS1 many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building. the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety (if the derigible crashed over New York). For all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start."	2	2		2																					
15737	6	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was noticing that the dirigibles would be unsafly dangling high above pedestrians on the Street. There were many risk when landing the huge dirigibles and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrolably and crash into the Sharp Spires on other buildings around it. In @CAPS1 of becoming the of transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15397	6	"The builders - designers of the empire state building faced many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" (@NUM1). The thousand foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame. Next was the question of safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire will make a huge explosion, as an example with the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obsticle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2) and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" which would be extremly unsafe. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. All of these obsticles put together caused the idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail."	4	3		4																					
15231	6	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
16309	6	"There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg accident. Nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady. The last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks."	2	2		2																					
15804	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a frame that would be able to stand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were facing was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is very flammable. They were afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would fall down to densely populated city below. And there was nothing that they could do to change this. A third obstacle they were facing was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible be constantly moving around while passangers tried to get on and off, which would not be safe. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced."	3	4		4																					
15365	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."	3	2		3																					
16593	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind.

That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.	1	2		2																					
15747	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved."	3	3		3																					
15297	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high.

The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now"""	2	2		2

If a blimp tried to dock there, the back would be whipped around and could end up harming someone. Being that high up, that's dangerous.Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable as witnessed with the Hindenburg. When that happened, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 thought it was too risky having those things flying over highly populated areas.There were laws made prohibiting low aircrafts over densely populated urban areas, so there could be no docking or they'd be breaking the law every time they did. That wasn't a risk the owner's wanted to take.The idea of the mooring mast was a very under- thought idea.

15839	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigibles on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there.

The Winds at that height were strong, violent and constantly Shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swireled around the mooring mast.Another hazard was that most dirigiples from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that @CAPS3. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against Airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building."	3	3		3																					
15668	6	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem.	1	1		1																					
16134	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
14841	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast.

The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass.

""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area.""

The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast.

Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians.

15048	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that builders had to work harder and figure out ways to get this to work. Architects and engineers talked with experts about the equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also states that they asked people to test the dirigible. They had to work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to work properply. Getting the mooring mast to work was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""

If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."	4	4		4

""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law.

Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building.

The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the sky scraper would effect the frame. In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon let go.

Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after an incident with a German dirigible being destroyed, they realized how dangerous it would be over a densely populated area. Another reason was nature. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" This made it hard to tie up and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to get off safely. Even a navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" There was even a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The mooring on top of the Empire State building was destined to fail because of all the obstacles that the builders faced."	4	4		4																					
15030	6	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One proble they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible like the Hindenburg. Then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city they could easly crash. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tryed to get close enough it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building.Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up wind currents can be very strong and changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. The final obstical builders would have to over come was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building than they would have been doing so illegally."	3	4		4																					
15078	6	The following are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable and considering the disaster The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship. And they feared wind would be blowing it into the spires of the building which would puncture the blimp shell.	2	1		2																					
15983	6	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to anchor at the top of the building. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether adds stress to the buildings frame, the architects needed to find a way to transmit the stress of the wind pressure and dirigibles load to the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation. Safety had played a major role in the fate of the mooring mast. Outside the United States most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to catch fire above a densely populated area there would be disaster. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature. Above the Empire State Building the wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the shape would still be unstable to land."	4	4		4																					
16188	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.

Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The acciedent of Hindenburg also raised alarm. Hindenburg set fire on Lakehurst in New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the acciedent could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York. Another factor were the wind currents. They were constantly @CAPS1. This would cause the back Of the dirigible to sway and move about. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons obstacles the builders fased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15649	6	The builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 threw many obstacles. They consulted with experts taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station.

The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3

Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" @CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project."	3	3		3

15858	6	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.	2	3		3																					
15086	6	"There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get.

16032	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the beginning, builders were faced with obstacles of very high expectations. Expectations including the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: being ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as said by John Tauranac.With the desire to now be a dock for what was known at the time as the ""transportation of the future"", came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of getting passengers safely off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was nearly impossible to fix in populated @CAPS1.Y.C. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise, was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas."	2	2		2																					
15481	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15350	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibels to dock there. The main reason the diriibles couldn't dock there was because the dirigbles load. The load would cause stress. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigbles couldn't dock there. ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The dirigbles were docked by means of an electric winch.

Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed."	3	3		3																					
15146	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.	2	3		3

Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof.

""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (� @NUM1) A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being dock at the top of the Empire State Building, was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires.

The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president.

What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles."	3	4		4

Also with high-speed winds the mast would have be incredibly sturdy, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea would was found not only unsafe but it illegal.

Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast.

Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1).

They also had to make sure it would be safe, transporting people through this dirigible. It depended on the wind and climate. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform New @CAPS1 transportation. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe to the public."	2	2		2																					
14930	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof. It would add stress to the building's frame. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is very flamable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded, over downtown New York, then law suites would be made. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were shifting winds due to violent air currents and these winds would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	4		4																					
16544	6	"When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished."	4	3		3																					
14927	6	"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible becacse of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over new york and the people in new york."	2	2		2																					
16304	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, There fore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were not able to build a mooring mast a top the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15138	6	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast"	3	3		3																					
15444	6	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question"	3	3		3																					
16548	6	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
16610	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
15543	6	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped."	2	3		3																					
15266	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic."	2	3		3																					
16251	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there like safety, nature, and existing law.  In the excerpt the author tells how many dirigibles use hydrogen which is very flammable.  That makes it very dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York is so densely populated it would probably harm many people.  People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible.  Another problem builders face was nature.  In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.  So that meant it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building.  Builders faced so many obstacles about allowing derigibles to dock on the Empire State Building it just wasn't meant to be."	4	4		4																					
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
15000	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
15925	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.  Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face."	3	3		3																					
15729	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safty factors and nature its self.Safty was a big obstacle in this plan for a morning mast because the dirigibles use hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building relized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to cech of fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners relized how much worse that accident could have been in New York.""The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and ontop of the building they were constantly changeing makeing it hard to dock. ""The winds ontop of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast couldn't be done."	3	3		3																					
16130	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast the builders of the empire state building had to go through many obstacles to get there job done. I paragraph @NUM1 it states that al smith announces that the empire state building will reach a height of @NUM2 feet, this would be a big obstacle for the builders because they have to risk their lives being that high up just to construct this building. Another obstacle for the workers would be working next to the dirigibles because in the exerpt it state that the dirigible a extreamely flammable so if it touches fire the workers could get seriously hurt."	1	1		1																					
15487	6	Some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing it was hard/unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building.	1	2		2																					
15417	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful."	3	3		3																					
15206	6	"One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles."	3	3		2																					
16401	6	"Dirigibles had a top speed of Eighty milles per hour, and they could Cruise at Seventy milles per hoor for thousands of milles witout needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet the same length as four bloks in New York City. The one obstacole to their expanded use in New York was the lak of a suitable landing area. The greatest obstacle to the sucsessful use of the mooring mast was nature it salf a window on the top were Constantly @CAPS1 due to biolent air corents."	2	2		2																					
15818	6	"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical."	2	2		2																					
14913	6	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a dangor for the citizens of New York City, but due to the weather conditions it was dangorous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. L�sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This goes to show that any project should be checked for safety precautions at all times."	3	3		3																					
15279	6	"In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. With this idea the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific Ocean. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	1		2																					
15415	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself."	2	1		2																					
15064	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This quote by Irving Clavan is saying that there is many problems unsolved because of the height made. Which means its harder to do because of how high it is. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible."" They're pointing that out because if ever a chance of a mess up and it starts to come crashing down, its coming down on one of the most populated cities in america. These are some obstacles builders have to face."	3	1		2																					
16579	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable.""

15571	6	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse.

15967	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets."	2	3		2																					
15103	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast."	4	3		4

16605	6	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders were faced with several different obstacles. One obstacle the builders faced was how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" because it would add too much stress to the buildings frame. Another obsticle along with the modifications to the buildings' frame was the money. Building this new structure would cost, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"". One of the most important obsticles however was safety. Although most blimps in the united states use helium, outside countries mainly use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flamable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the winds which were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" because the back of the blimp could not be weighed down and also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make their attempts not only dangerous, but illegal. In the end, the mooring mast was never completed."	4	4		4																					
16511	6	"The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below.

(Which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform.In all, over sixty thousand dollers worth of modifications had to be made to the builings foundation. And some dirigibles couldnt even dock"	1	1		1																					
15956	6	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they over looked several key factors. The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the diridible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hoovering over the streets of New York City."	2	3		3																					
15927	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas.""

There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers.

16143	6	"Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles."	4	3		4																					
15770	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles from Outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area. A second obstacle was that the dirigible with be swivelling around the mast because of violent air currents. The dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face."	4	4		4																					
15289	6	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Owners of the Empire State Building than recognized that if the same incident was to take place in New York, more lives would be lost. Builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
15097	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law. And don't forget what happens of the dirigible crashes in the area of New York City."	4	3		4																					
16550	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
16223	6	"From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire state building were numerous. an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. another was controll of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently. Safety as well as an issue, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeplin caught fire and exploded. "	2	3		3																					
15832	6	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attemting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommidate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, wich would puncture the dirigibles shell."	2	2		2																					
14909	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt said ""the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail."" A somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium"" which is a much more unstable gas and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another obstacle the builders faced was ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it very difficult to ancor a dirigible down to the mast and as the excerpt said they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. Those are the problems faced by the builders of the empire state building."	3	3		3																					
15791	6	"In this excerpt there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face were the dirigible and the sucess of the mooring mast. The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. It could also weight down and dangle above the pedestrians wasn't safe. All in all these were the obstacles they had to face."	1	1		1																					
14954	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below."	2	2		2																					
15247	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems."	3	3		3																					
16492	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
16331	6	"The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who where constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole idea.Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attahed to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builder are going to try this con cept which means they have to lead by example. If not then the other builders would have major problems people would be in danger.The builders and men who thought about using weights to balence off the weight of the ship. They needed to find a safe way accomplish this and unforunantly they could not. If they went through with it, one accident could have killed many people.The Dirigible was a great idea but they should have thought out the ideas before they went ahead and built it."	2	2		2																					
16261	6	"During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	2		3																					
15600	6	"The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use."	2	2		2																					
15814	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders faced was that of nature. ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" (@NUM1) The violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe. Another problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
15746	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature and the law. Safety issues was a problem because in the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This explains why they couldn't do it because of one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played it's role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15380	6	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L�sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it."	3	3		3																					
15309	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One problem was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" @CAPS1 a dirigible catch fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous. Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles. These obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
16432	6	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. Those are some of the obstacle they had to allow the dirigibles to dock there.	1	1		1																					
16233	6	"First of all the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over @NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible."	1	2		2																					
15827	6	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe."" As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building."	3	4		4																					
16531	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it.

The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot to do to the violent air currents, even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast the wind would push the back all the way around the mast. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was that they feared that the lead weights that held the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians and for the pilot and passengers on the blimp."	2	2		2																					
16323	6	"The builders @CAPS1 many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships From ""flying too low over urban area's"" as explained in paragraph @NUM1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders @CAPS1 the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmited over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weigh over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph @NUM2. Also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical problems."	3	3		3																					
15305	6	"Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between @CAPS1, saftey, and nature, there was no way this idea could ever work. Although the idea was good it was very impracticle.     Saftey was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands.      Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous.     Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impracticle. It never happened due to saftey and now serves as a tea and soda area for use of sight seers."	3	3		3

These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16234	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City.

The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets.

15801	6	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."".

14867	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful.

The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework.

16458	6	"In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability."	2	1		2																					
16391	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock"	4	4		4																					
15644	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical."	3	3		3

16554	6	"Builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting durables be able to dock there. Some of these obstacles weren't caused by the building it self, nature took part of it due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet it was hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up. This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930. Another obstacle builders faced was that an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas witch would put civilians on the street at risk.

The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.      Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street."	3	3		3

He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship.

Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas.

At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful."	3	4		4

Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas.

15970	6	"The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there."	3	4		4																					
15068	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in building a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first obstacle was the inadequate framework on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, much stress would be added to the building. It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which could also be a cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fires above heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swivelling the ship around the mast. The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if the building of the mast was a success, the law against dirigibles coming too close would prevent the use of it. All these obstacles the builders faced led to the ultimate failure of the mast."	4	4		4																					
15229	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102.	1	2		2																					
16382	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1 dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15183	6	"while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them which ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. A lot of money was spent on these new renevations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame. But overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles."	2	2		2																					
15433	6	"During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building."	3	3		3																					
16606	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. It would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced."	1	1		1																					
15834	6	"Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes."	4	3		4

15594	6	Based on excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles were that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	3		3

For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."	3	4		4																					
15390	6	There were many obstacles the builders had to take.

15673	6	"There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the empire state Building. One problem would be the foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the buildings foundation, @CAPS1 squishing it down. The architects would need to have made adjustments to the Foundation in order for a dirigible to land. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked. when the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast.

Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse."	3	3		3																					
15887	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock tere. Many foriegn dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it a float.

When the owners of the Empire State building the severity of this happening they were turned off.Nature if anything was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"". The law if anything was pretty important to get approved, and tere was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
15997	6	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality.

Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16418	6	"When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem.

Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe.

Maybe one day they will fix it."	2	2		2																					
15685	6	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether"" then stress would be put on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over @MONEY1 modifying the framework (From paragraph @NUM1).

As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself.""

Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking.

Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1.

The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
14986	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																					
14987	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4

15515	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly. Mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""	3	4		4																					
15170	6	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building."	2	3		3

A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above that pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used dock blimps."	4	4		4																					
16189	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3		3																					
15212	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind.

It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	1	2		2

These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	3	4		4

Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side.

Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical."	2	2		2																					
16499	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem.Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1.In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or ******** this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects."	4	4		4																					
15382	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings.

This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured.

One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4

The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock.

The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative.

In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation."	3	3		3

First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent."	3	2		3																					
15971	6	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were two strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (� @NUM1). Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (� @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (� @NUM3).

They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems."	2	2		2																					
15561	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, L�sted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As L�sted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful."	3	4		4																					
16581	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16236	6	"The obstacles that the Empire State Building faced were alot. So that the dirigibles; blimps could dock there.One obstacle was building more floors. They had to build more floors so that the people on the dirigibles could have somewere to load and unload on the ship.Another obstacle was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor. This costed them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications, that had to be done to the buildings framework"	1	1		1																					
16421	6	"There were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because must dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15564	6	"Right now I going to tell us Some of the obtacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This is why never was completed the mooring mast (dirigible) for this serious obstacles to put this in the Empire state building."	3	3		3																					
15937	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon L�sted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population that is a risk that cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds the dirigible, even tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was according to the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation. Even though the builders spent a lot of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplish its full potential."	3	4		4																					
15704	6	"In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."	2	2		2																					
15743	6	"If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea"	3	3		3																					
15969	6	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigables would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel."	3	2		3																					
15976	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building.

Passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened.

14862	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there was many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing diriibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The drigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the dirible down. This put the diribles too close to the people. There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem with that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow diribles to get close enough to tie down to the mast.

""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell.

Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.

However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."	3	4		4

So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3.

This would allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers off and on.Another obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the stress being added to the building's frame because of a one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether. To accommodate the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened and modified. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The final and greatest obstacle for successful use of the mooring mast was nature.

15676	6	"In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt.

16002	6	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.	1	2		2																					
15560	6	"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared."	4	3		4

One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast."	3	2		3																					
15482	6	"In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe.

14842	6	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3

Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4).

15824	6	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles.

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. The planning of where these aircrafts to land and re-fill was not an easy task for the builders."	3	2		3																					
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
15842	6	"Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high speed winds and being able to get passengers off and on. They never did solve this problem, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was."	1	2		2																					
15272	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station."	3	3		3																					
16097	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	3		3																					
16299	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the buildings frame. L�sted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen."	3	3		3																					
16297	6	". The Empire State Building during it's construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. The builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. Most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. Due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why, the mast was unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
15982	6	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated."	3	3		3																					
15825	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical."	3	3		3																					
14854	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the buildings structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds. of pedestrians on the streets of New York City."	3	3		3																					
16114	6	"While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden."	1	1		1																					
16062	6	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed."	3	3		3

As stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle As stated in paragraph @NUM2 was nature ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. In addition the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3 ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". With the law in the way no one would even want to try. Those are the three major problems found when building the mast"	4	3		4

Also the dirigibles body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open oservation platform. Finally the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equiment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey."	1	1		1

If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to branish around the mast. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was the law forbidding air vessels of flying too low over urban areas. A problem that would condemn the theory from the start."	3	3		3																					
16626	6	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium.

The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse.

This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.

The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down.

""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (� @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey and the Empire State building owners realized how bad a fire could be in downtown New York, which is densely populated.

This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked.

A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15432	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																					
16339	6	"The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay."	3	3		3

Builders also wantd the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation Of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast  Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas.

Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on.The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof if a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame."	1	2		2

The examples above were all complications that restricted the derigibles to moor at the Empire State building."	2	2		2

But, this plan had many @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"".  This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself.  Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen.""  Hydrogen is a very flamable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk.  The third Reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15523	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4																					
15084	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle they had to face they had to add to more floors to the building to make a grand total of 102 floor. The 101st floor was a glassed-in observation area and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor.	1	2		2																					
16366	6	"Al Smith and his workers, went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen, meant HIGHLY flammable."	3	3		3																					
15695	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The dirigibles also called blimps were very big, this was a problem because they were to large and could not get to the building and ""most dirigible outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1) This is bad because an accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city and hurt thousands of people The winds above the building were sometimes violent and it was hard for dirigibles to reach it, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (par. @NUM2) It was difficult attempting to allow dirigibles dock the Empire State Building.

The excerpt explains the steps of building the building as well is the obstacles and challenges that the builder faced. The architects of building the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, did not take into account the problems that may come with taking on such a large project.The creator of this plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so excited to build the mast, that he did not think about the complications associated with his ""master"" plan. Because of the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure, it was necessary for the building's frame to be strengthened which costed over  sixty thousand dollars. The greatest obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was known to be very flammable. If something like that happened over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This excerpt shows that before you leap on a large challenge, you should look and take into account obstacles that may come with that."	3	4		4																					
15152	6	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality."	2	1		2																					
15941	6	"Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."	1	1		1

Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area."	3	4		4

Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas.

They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles."" @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports that obstacle ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame"". A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. After german dirigible was on fire in Jersey they realized how serious they situation can become.

15249	6	"When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work."	3	3		3

Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable.

""Even if the dirigible wer tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1).

The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it.

Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disasterous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated.

If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below.

Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.

One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety.

The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.

There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York.

Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast.

Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways."	3	3		3																					
16388	6	"The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flameable."" @CAPS1 it is flameable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like New York City. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building."	3	2		3

By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. Although these obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of mother nature herself, cannot."	2	3		3

The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down the other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"".

To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct somthing that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the buildings frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fufill its destiny was for safety.

To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it.

The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly.

This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities.

However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way.

From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds @CAPS1 it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that  airships were not to fly too low over urban areas.

Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date.

As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3		3																					
15562	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field."	4	3		4																					
15566	6	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obsticles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steal frame.This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles making their dreams quite impossible."	4	4		4																					
16518	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps.     In paragraph 6 the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and let passengers off and on."" That's one obstacle of his company. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" The buildings structure didn't really help the dirigibles much."	1	1		1																					
15655	6	"The builders of the Empire State building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a dock dirigible would add. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast author Marcia Amidon L�sted states ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building. L�sted says ""Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State building. The wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe. L�nden states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigibles were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York the casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15190	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles They would not be able to simply place of mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16044	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L�sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Most of the problems were avoidable, except for that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."""	3	3		3																					
14936	6	"During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction."	3	3		3																					
16068	6	"The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue- @CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start."	4	4		4																					
15198	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibes to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building.

15168	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937.

15880	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15907	6	"The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal."	3	3		3																					
15302	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and dirigibles were a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose."	4	3		4																					
15879	6	"Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was seriously considered, safety and reality made in an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. Still @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered."	4	4		4

A second potential problemb was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consiquence feared by the piolet of Los Angeles.

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low.

15936	6	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions.

This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

15679	6	"To have a building built Over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas.

15722	6	"The builders of the empire State Building faced many problems atempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were safety concerns. One issue was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flamable and explosive gas. A fire acident would be catastrophic, since down town newyork is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed.

For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land.

16177	6	"There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2,"	2	2		2																					
15191	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed."	3	3		3																					
15276	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building.

When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"	3	3		3																					
16587	6	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles.

In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame.

Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible.

As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3).

In an atemp to make the building stronger the builders had to spend over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on the improvement of the skeleton or frame. There were also laws in place that did not allow large aircraft to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there. There were many problems and the landing of a dirigible on the empire state building never happened."	3	3		3																					
14979	6	Some of the Problems they faced building the emPire State building was the hight. building a buildig that high up and also epecting it to do things such as bording dirigibles.

15658	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4		4																					
15815	6	"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire state building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire state building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast."	3	3		3																					
16045	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."	4	4		4																					
16543	6	"When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable."	1	1		1																					
16573	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (�@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16098	6	"The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people."	1	2		2																					
14857	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular."	4	4		4																					
14965	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating."	2	2		2																					
14856	6	"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle. Which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there.  Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area. As well as not being able to fit. Thus, there was some need of more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Which was the lack of a suitable area."	2	1		2

The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes."	3	2		3																					
15479	6	In the story construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having a dirigible's dock ontop of the empire State Building was comming to an end. When thinking about the idea the architecture Never put thought in legal persasures as in air crafts cant fly low on urban areas. Also the heavy wind that picks up from the building making the air craft hard to controll. Another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians. If not @CAPS1 right the air craft can get loose and dingle down to urban areas or like the german dirigible catch on fire and Blow up. Even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air.	3	2		3																					
16158	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	3		3																					
15714	6	"When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed, as well as more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to wind, and passengers could not get on the blimp. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16128	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1."	4	3		4																					
15477	6	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast."	3	3		3																					
16500	6	"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people."	3	2		3																					
15096	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building taste some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock.  The dock would break the laws.  The dock would also be a danger to the people below.  It would also put a lot of stress to the frame of the building."""	1	1		1																					
15470	6	"In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"	3	3		3																					
14995	6	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."	3	4		4

If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment.

They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity.Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 kept pooring down, one of them being nature.Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream."	2	2		2																					
15705	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the stress the blimp would put on the building As the article states here, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to  accomodate the situation."", the stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."	4	4		4																					
16343	6	"The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldnt be very safe have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldnt stop and went straight into the tower. Also the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work to well."	2	2		2																					
15429	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3

The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tied to a building. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
16407	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die."	3	3		3

Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flamable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated are such as downtown @LOCATION2. Safety was a major concern an accident like Hindenburg was something they do not want to risk.      The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficut. With strong winds, after the tethor cable was attached, the back end of the air craft would be blown around making the aviator of the blimp hard to control.      Also, a law stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was stated especially after the incodent of hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building     The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major saftey and difficult concern.

But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems.

Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
15388	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which the desinged a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was to strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldnt due it because there was a law that airships flying to low over urban areas."	3	3		3

There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the @CAPS1 is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed."	2	3		3

For @CAPS3, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transnitted all the way to the building's foundation. This shows that not only did they have to designed to take the load of the building but also the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether. The engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt In all the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to over come many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15357	6	"There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.

15109	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used."	2	2		2																					
15944	6	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (� @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."	4	4		4																					
15155	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is so tall that the winds were very fast and it would constantly change direction due to violent air currents. This made it very hard to dock the Dirigibles. Also another obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most ballons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If a dirigible got caught on fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its people. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle. The dirigibles were so large that the buildings structure was at danger of failing and destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was the law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles to dock on it."	4	3		4

Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @CAPS3 over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles Into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop.

16064	6	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building.

This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified.

16276	6	The builders faced many problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle the had was the wind. At that elevation the was constantly shifting.

Those are some of the obstacle the builder faced.	2	1		2																					
14888	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that it would have to of been a very dificult situation and chalenging to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I would have to say would be the wind pressure they had when the thouand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable that must of been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard. Over sixty thousand dollers' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do alot of work that would take a while to get done if it has all over sixty thousand dollers' worth of work they had to do @CAPS1 on the frame work."	1	2		2

15935	6	"One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe."	3	3		3																					
16028	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would die. Also a lot of people would die from it too. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced."	1	1		1																					
15423	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia L�sted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."	2	3		3																					
16135	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.	1	2		2																					
16590	6	"The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the buildings strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong inef to ""transmite pressure from the dirigibe's load to the buildings foundation."" Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the buildings cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework just to make the building strong inuf to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible."	4	3		4																					
16022	6	"The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers.

15592	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers @CAPS2 was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @CAPS1 in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16464	6	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the empire State building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1) For, in dang this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close engough to tie up because of  forceful winds"" (line @NUM2)"	2	2		2																					
14991	6	"During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
16215	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved."	1	2		2																					
16138	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the moring mast violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that air ships flying to low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project. Overall it was too far fetch of an idea.	2	3		3																					
15184	6	"Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of @LOCATION1 would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it."	3	2		3																					
15819	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3																					
16533	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles.  In an attempt to keep up with The modern world, Al Smith, lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided top the building with the dirigible docking station.  Unfortunatlley, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast.  One of these problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building.  Another was the flamibility of hydrogen the gas used in inflating the ship.  But the biggest obstacle was nature.  The winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash.  A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldnt fly too low over urban areas.  Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, many obstacles stopped it from having success."	3	3		3

15026	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they had great intentions but faced some obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it's not as simple as it might sound. If the builders added a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame. All of the stress would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. This would cost over @MONEY1, and thats a lot. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the wind up at the top was constantly shifting. This wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law against airships driving too low and this would enable them from being able to dock. Also since other dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obsticle for the builders was saftey when they were building this, there were many unsafe outcomes so it was too risky to construct."	3	4		3																					
15548	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
16000	6	"It is stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose,"" and that proves to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law. This law states that airships can not fly to low over urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face."	4	4		4																					
16027	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16484	6	"There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there."	3	3		3

""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3

Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord it was appling stress to the build because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up the wind was excrushiating. The last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps.

Another example, of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety.

The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

14990	6	"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons."	4	3		4																					
16224	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, dirigibles docking on top of the building, and a law for dirigibles. The architects and builders spend a lot of time building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed. A law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles. These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
16513	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. One obsticle the builders faced was that they had to modify the buildings framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure wood have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below."" That was another obsticle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obsticle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The idea was neither practicle nor safe."	2	3		3																					
16255	6	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimphs of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible."	3	2		3																					
15890	6	"When the builders of the Empire state Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obsticles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside.

Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents.

As L�sted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field.

15614	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned the building reached to 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area.The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles for the design of the attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof including adding height to the building. The foremost problem though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened and in doing so it would allow a dirigible to moor on the top with no issues to the structure of the building."	2	1		2																					
15383	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues and the Empire @CAPS3 Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and building."	3	2		3

In order to do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars in modifications of the framework. Builders had to make it 102 floors and also create a glassed-in observation area along with an open observation platform, furthermore, they had to complete the roof and then move on to building the steel mast with glass windows. After all that time and money spent in re-creating the building, the dirigibles couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the back of the ship would always be moving. Also, there is a law that airships cant fly too low over urban areas. It wasn't worth it in the end."	2	3		3

In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem.

Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights.

Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city.

The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature.

For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2																					
16508	6	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company.

Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city."	3	2		3

The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."""	1	1		1																					
14904	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved."	3	3		3																					
15621	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
16567	6	"Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast.As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was haulted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing."	2	2		2																					
16254	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles they had to face in order to fulfill the @ORGANIZATION1. The Empire State Building is @NUM1 feet tall which made for some problems. L�sted stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the Mooring Mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind speed on the top of the Empire State building would be terrible because the Dirigible's tail is basically weightless and it would move around violently which could make the support beams give out, or could put people's life in danger below. L�sted said, ""But using these at the Empire State Building; where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street is neither practical nor safe."" Another reason as to why the Mooring Mast can not be constructed is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. L�sted stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" It is not legal for the Dirigible to even be in the viscinity of the building which makes it impossible to do."	3	3		3																					
16393	6	"The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas."	3	4		4																					
15930	6	"In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties"	3	4		4																					
15047	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success."	3	3		3																					
15915	6	"The building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the very start Al Smith never thought about the safety of the people. ""When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium this was a cause for very flammible possibilities. If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."	3	3		3																					
16057	6	"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself.

The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a stainless steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and would need lead weights to hold it down. This was clearly considered unsafe. Finally the safety of the passengers, was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Also, There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16340	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas.First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco.Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical.Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law.In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas."	4	4		4																					
16627	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city.Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk.Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law.

As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up. All in all, the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a genius idea, but too many obstacles sprung up for it to be in use."	4	4		4

Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around.

They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas.

This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger."	3	3		3																					
15125	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building and not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared."	3	3		3																					
15897	6	"Marcia @CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The Steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives @CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill it's purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York."	3	3		3																					
16619	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1) if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality."	2	2		2																					
15403	6	"In constructing and building the empire State building to make it allowable for dirigables to dock there took alot of thinking on the builders' part. First they had to see what the building could handle and try to calculate what it held so it wouldn't fall. Then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders' put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public and the plan had to be shut down. Although it makes a good story and is a crutial learning block for constructers to be."	1	1		1																					
15055	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers."	2	3		3																					
16092	6	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."	4	4		4																					
16424	6	"The Empire State Building was designed to become the world tallest buiding, with a few tricks up its sleave. The building was originally planned to also function as a Mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately many problems lay in the way interning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. ""The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safty of civilians in New York City. Another problem which was encountered with the building was the wind."" the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast... (the dirigibles) dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. A third problem the builders had was the leaglity of the issue of mooring ships the buildings. There was an existing law against air ships flying to low over urban areas. ""With this law in place it would have been impossible for ships to moor. Although the builders had good intentions, they failed to realize the reality of the situation."	3	3		3																					
15980	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law."	3	3		3																					
15100	6	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting."" It would not be safe to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
16199	6	"The early @DATE1's was a time where everyone was out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two tycoons were competing to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man creating the Empire State building, had an idea to make his building taller and more popular; build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though a good and creative idea, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be more than they bargained for.first off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was very unpractible without changing the whole design."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would put so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obsitacl these architects faced while building this.

14974	6	"There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp."	3	3		3																					
15485	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. there were natural reasons and mechanical reasons. As well as time and safety. Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location of the building. When the to blimps attempted to go near to test it out One was too unstable to dock and the other through paper down a rope ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time and blimps wher flammable and dangerouse. Also, flying at that hight is illegal."	2	2		2																					
15846	6	"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles."	4	4		4																					
15826	6	"When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped."	3	3		3																					
15104	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, Empire State Building building faced many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused a dirigible to be destroyed by fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around-a safety hazard for pedestrians below. Lastly, it was illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well-liked but in the end it had too many problems and proved to be impractical."	3	2		3

The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support.

Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen.

As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo.

The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it.

One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction."	3	2		3

This reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas.

The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring.

Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well.

A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong.

This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas.

The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below.

In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice.

The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks.

Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the moore mast on the building."	4	4		4																					
16180	6	"Acording to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" and Then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. Another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, The set altitude was higher then the building was tall. The last obsticle was safety, in paragraph @NUM2 @CAPS1 talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. The mooring mast on the Empire State building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work."	3	3		3																					
16434	6	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the @CAPS1. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to @CAPS1 there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's.  Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the @CAPS1 from ever being used.	2	2		2																					
14905	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed."	1	1		1																					
16426	6	"Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired."	3	3		3

Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas.

16272	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon L�sted."	3	4		4																					
15609	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
15588	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another obstacle was the buildings structure if the blimp had docked there would be stress on the building ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"""	3	3		3																					
16564	6	"Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles."	4	4		4

The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing and then they would know that wind up higher gets ruffer. Bacicaly should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were ney laws which there was; Also, all that work for nothing.

16193	6	"During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be."	3	3		3																					
15089	6	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea. "	4	3		4																					
16516	6	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast was the winds and the gases used in non-@CAPS1 dirigibles. The wind was a problem because that high up the dirigibles' back would swivle around the mooring mast. The gases used was a problem because out of country zeppelins used hydrogen which was highly flammable which would be bad if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated New York.	2	2		2

As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling any air above pedestrians which was neither practical or safe.

15780	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."	4	4		4																					
15063	6	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

15506	6	"The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite."	3	3		3																					
15763	6	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building.

From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" @CAPS1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock.

Al Smith, the Architect working on the Empire State Building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost @MONEY1 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldnt use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building.

Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas.

15768	6	"The builders of the Empire State building face a couple challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another accident like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse."	2	1		2																					
16165	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe."	2	2		2																					
15005	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropt, though some ships have tried to dock their."	3	3		3																					
15498	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced alot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. They usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. In New York they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They worried an accident like the Hindenburg could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The Final obstacle was Forceful winds. They could blow the dirigible onto the Sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the Shell, the captain couldn't take his hands off the control levers. All in all the mooring mast was not a very well thoughtout idea and it would not have been safe at all."	3	3		3																					
16231	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature and the law. One of the greatest obstacle was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of @CAPS1 and then catches on fire, that could end badly another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents' which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close. So those are some obstacles builders faced in building the Empire State building to dock blimps."	3	3		3

The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York."	3	3		3																					
16140	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4		4																					
14883	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants."	3	3		3																					
16433	6	"When allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown new york"". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york.

One of the obstacles the builders faced was the agianst airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough To tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.

Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.

14929	6	"Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast.

With all the trafic of New York you would most likly not want a burning dirigible falling overhead."	2	2		2																					
15144	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the empire State building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The empire State building was already standing in the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the buildings frame. They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building. They would break the law of airships flying to low in urban areas. So the empire state building was finished but you could not use it for dirigible's.	3	2		3																					
15061	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.	3	3		3																					
14885	6	"Based on excerpt builders of Empire State building faced alot of obsticles. Here are my three points to consider. They need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash in to the building. It was too high firstly. The builders needed to make long difficult, plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, The Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, The mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obsticles. The plans were difficult the Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high."	2	2		2																					
15474	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there."	4	4		4																					
15218	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether would only add stress to the frame. To fix this problem the @ORGANIZATION1 steel frame would need to be modified and strengthened to support the mooring mast and dirigible.	2	2		2																					
15457	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4		3																					
15960	6	"Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.

15884	6	"The builders of the empire state building had to face alot of obsticles to try to get dirgibles to land there.

15993	6	"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through alot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay."	1	1		1																					
16169	6	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 a baloon and dirigible may have the same appearance the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly which is highly flamable. Secondly there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured it could collaps into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
16162	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream."	3	3		3																					
16345	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

15004	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."	4	4		4																					
15310	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles."	3	3		3																					
15773	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp.

15520	6	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building.

""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most @CAPS2 dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly.

For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over Urban areas.In @CAPS2 based on excerpt The Mooring Mast; by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability, money issues, and safety reasons."	4	4		4

The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened.""

So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building.

15934	6	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1.

(@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building."	3	2		3

Another One was Also in paragraph @NUM1 when they said ""The greatest reason was one of safty: Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in lakehurst, New, Jersey, the owners of the empire state building relized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated Area such as downtown New York. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says that nature was a big obsticle for the success of the mooring mast. The winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another reason was because of existing laws was airships flying too low over populated or urban areas."	3	3		3

First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building.  The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp.  another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around.  In conclusion, they did face many problems."	0	2		1																					
16341	6	"Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work."	3	3		3																					
16154	6	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more.Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building."" The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed. There were too many obstacles."	4	3		4																					
15945	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the buildings framework because docking a dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible."	4	3		4																					
15836	6	"Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	1	1		1																					
15094	6	"Based on the excerpt from the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in building the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law said that airships could not fly too low over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would directly violate that law when the ships come in to dock. Another problem the builders faced was the danger surrounding the airships that would be docking there. The airships, called dirigibles, were like giant balloons and could pop if they touched something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spires on top. Therefore, if the dirigible bumps one of these spires, it could pop and go plummeting to the ground. This presented another problem. Had an airship popped in New York City, it could've killed a large number of people not only in it, but on the ground. During the time of building, the Hindenburg crashed into fields, killing all of it's passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if that had happened in the city. This was the final straw for the builders as they abandoned their lofty goal, because of too many problems."	3	4		4																					
14964	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most aparent problems was its a urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking the street. They didnt want to dirigibles flying so close over with out not knowing wha's gunna happen. Another thing was that the German dirigible had been destroyed by fire. They had to think about how worse that could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and completely destroying the building. Also how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold a dirible. There were many problems they didn't think about in the process, that's why the mooring mast wasn't successful as planned."	2	2		2																					
15751	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire state building was already huge & fragile so adding a lot of way to it, would not have helped, ""a @DATE1 foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects could not want this, they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1, it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"". After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful."	3	3		3																					
15517	6	"Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the empire state Building had to be modified and strengthened to accomodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe."	3	3		3																					
14877	6	"The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea."	2	1		2																					
14980	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamable. This would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. All and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people."	3	3		3																					
16461	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (L�sted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
15862	6	"The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe."	2	2		2																					
15984	6	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to be working at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and strength of the building, but also the top. ""Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again - this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast.""

The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."	2	2		2																					
15798	6	"Trying to allow dirigibles dock on the Empire State building caused way to many obsticals for the builders. Dirigibles were up too one thousand feet long, this would make it realistically impossible for it to dock because the size of it would add stress to the buildings frame builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger. Most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not hellium which I highly flamable if cought fire pedestrians could be seriously hurt.

15278	6	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame.

""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous.

15519	6	"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to the mainly safety reasons the Docking station for dirigibles was never built."	3	3		4																					
15573	6	"When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful."	3	3		3

This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2		3

They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions.

16545	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3

Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street.

15222	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast making it impossible for passengers to exit. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"". This is a very black and white problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
16598	6	"The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the to of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame.

The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be to heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't made for that much weight. Some dirigible were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was to dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other particle reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

This law wouldn't allow dirigible to land at the Empire State Building due to its location."	4	4		4																					
16358	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure @CAPS1, If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big citie's streets. Finally, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable. That is why the mooring mast was dangerous."	1	2		2																					
15056	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles."	2	2		2

The architects had to realize they couldn't @CAPS1 drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, they had to realize the consequences and danger, like the wind pressure. Also, fires if a firework you happen many people would get hurt or killed due to New York's population The architects faced many obstacles but then taught them the danger and outcome if building the mooring Mast."	2	3		3																					
14931	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obsticales in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem with the height and alltitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they docked, the back of it would be moving around everywhere from the wind. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937 the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff. witch means that it was very flamable from using hydrogen instead of helium. All raised safty issues that needed to be sought out."	2	2		2																					
16301	6	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building.

14887	6	"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15809	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea.Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stateing that airships couldn't fly to low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried using the mooring mast."	2	3		3																					
15843	6	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end."	3	3		3																					
15054	6	"They ran into a few problems when it @CAPS1 to building this. They realized after that it wasnt that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 floor building just by one cable tether. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldnt control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out it would be hard to keep it steady. And if there wasnt enough support on the building frames, then it could potentially collapse."	1	2		2																					
16178	6	"It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners."	3	3		3																					
15385	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas. In the end the plan failed."	3	3		3																					
15578	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it."	3	3		3																					
15353	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible."	3	3		3																					
15031	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at."	3	3		3																					
15757	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, they were mainly ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable"". A fire in one of these would be devastating being over an enormous city like New York. The wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mask"", and could even potentially puncture the frame. The whole idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would of been illegal for flying ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it dangerous, but aganst the law too. Overall, these were the obstacles that workers faced, and the obstacles that won out in the long run."	3	2		3																					
15046	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main reason was that it was illegal for dirigibles to dock. ""Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also mother nature prevented dirigibles ability to dock there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However some dirigibles attempted to dock. In 1930 the U.S. Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to the severe winds could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the city could cause a huge threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. The builders had to modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device. The builders were faced with legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16121	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

15400	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail."	3	3		3																					
15329	6	"While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New @CAPS1 geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly to low over highly populated urban cities."	4	3		4																					
15593	6	"The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems."	3	3		3																					
16454	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4		4

Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."	1	2		2

The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area."	3	3		3																					
14942	6	"The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared."	3	3		3

If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around & around the mooring mast, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammible. as you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building."	3	2		2																					
15771	6	"The idea of Hindenburg sized air ships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds propostorous in today's day in age. However in the 1920s this was a dream of many. Unfortunaetly this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the air ship itself, hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastorous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings. These two points aside, there was a ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality."	3	3		3																					
15090	6	"Based on the excerpt there are a few key obstacles the builders face, one being the safety of the people in the dirigibles and people below them, and two being nature itself.The safety of the people was critical because if something was not safe then it would not be put to use. There were many things that could go wrong such as, the blimp hitting a spire and killing all the people below.The Greatest obstacle was nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast it would get wraped around the building, or just getting to the mooring would be difficult because of the wind.Overall the mooring mast was not a practical Idea.

Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was @CAPS1 big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings.It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15007	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15200	6	"In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money."	3	4		4

15526	6	"The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, A series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched."	4	4		4																					
15127	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved."	3	4		4																					
15726	6	"Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out."	3	3		3																					
16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																					
16020	6	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. Al Smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. So when he found out he knew had to make his taller."	2	2		2

""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftyness will put stress on the buildings foundation and they don't want that stress to topal over the building. Also they say ""The winds on the top of the biulding were consistantly shifting due to the violant air current"". this says that they are worried  that the wind might take the balloon away from the building causing it to injure people these are only a few obsticals the builders had to face."	3	3		3																					
16184	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building.

Also, the wind at the top of the building put workers at great risk of falling off, or dying"	1	2		2																					
15781	6	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (� @NUM1). Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�@NUM3). This was mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it.

Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.""

The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.

15486	6	"When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there."	3	4		4

The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York.

This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building.

16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3

The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3

15489	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article "The Mooring Mast", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."	3	3		3

The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
15542	6	"The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were all a matter of public safety. They should have reallized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that they were thus prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been reallized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas.

Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish because it's against the law."	3	3		3

At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe."	4	4		4

These obstacles proved far to many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.	2	1		2																					
15451	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.

The addition of weights, used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians.

This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way.

16197	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."	3	3		3																					
16258	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety.

The stress of the dirigible, can cause crucial damage on the buildings frame. Also, it was not only the size the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis aswell. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worrys of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk. Along with all, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""

15959	6	"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute."	4	4		4																					
15535	6	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed."	3	1		2

There were a few different theorie's on what would be best, and how to develope the Mooring Mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the empire state Building. This structure helped support the mooring are, where the dirigibles were docked. But the fate of the Mast was not to bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire state building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true.

An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action."	1	2		2

Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station."	3	2		3

Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons.

This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked.

Their first problem was that they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building. Mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Another @CAPS1 is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable.

16190	6	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the buildings frame, Nature, and certain laws against it. A big problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the empire state building was the strength of the base. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""(paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire state building were always changing due to violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2). All of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the empire State building was never created."	3	4		4

Now he didnt @CAPS2 look into it if a blimp was to @CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the buildings foundation.

The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obtacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"".

When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
16264	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled.

Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.

Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around.

A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft.

In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L�sted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located.

One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas.

Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low.

A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas.

Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded.

As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to L�sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law."	4	3		4																					
16370	6	"some of the obstacles the builders went throw was that they had to make many changes, such as they could not just drop a mast on top of the Buildings flat roof. The blimp would give the building stress held by a single cable. the blimps load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The @CAPS1 could have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousands of dollars for the new frame work."	2	2		2																					
16361	6	"Builders in The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
16342	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."	1	2		2																					
14894	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that ""Should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This factor caused that the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders face was that the winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas. This ""law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" All these factors caused ""the idea of using the mooring mast for drigibles and passengers"" to disappear."	4	4		4																					
15018	6	"It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical or safe."	2	2		2																					
16631	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced some obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"". Another set back was it being illegal to fly an aircraft that low, it was ""illegal for ship to tie up to a building,"". Also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable. The Mooring Mask of the Empire State Building became nothing More than an attraction for sightseers."	2	3		3

One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1.

14940	6	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."	3	3		3																					
16241	6	"In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros."	3	3		3																					
16585	6	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock."	3	3		3																					
15769	6	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible @CAPS1 above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face will attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. For one thing the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart."	1	1		1

In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project."	3	3		3																					
15765	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let the dirigibles dock there.

As the author states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obsticle faced was due to the nature of where the building was located. Because of the location, the winds were so strong and the wind shifted constantly. The last obsticle the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen thirtie's, the idea landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air transportation was given to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15478	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Do to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obsticles the builders realized that if a forign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on forign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, another obsticle they faced violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around.

15508	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all."	3	4		4																					
15327	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there @CAPS1 was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, structure of the building had to be made stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States most the used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly to low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building.

This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"".

A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured.

The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds.

When there a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would collapse.

Another obstacle is it was expensive to build it. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York there are many places and people are tightly packed. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock.

This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame.

The workers had to change their first design to meet the mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to face the fact that overall, the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents. Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3).

The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4).

One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."	4	3		4																					
14917	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 with the amount the dirigible @PERSON1 and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle in attempting to get the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was high up @CAPS1 the wind currents were volatile and ""constantly shifting"" in result the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2 obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings, close by the dirigible could be pierced and would also be dangerous for the pedestrians in the city."	3	3		3																					
15355	6	"Architects had to face many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. The very first problem architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building because they could not Simply just drop one on, they had to go back and re-support the whole skeleton of the building. Another problem is if the dirigible were to fail like the hindenburg it would plument in a ball of fire to a very populated city down below. The greatest problems architects had to face was nature itself There were violent winds constantly if a dirigible had been tethered down it would move violently and go @CAPS1 down on pedestrians down below, which is too much of a risk for the architects to take."	3	2		3																					
15965	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in @LOCATION2 at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose."	3	4		4																					
16238	6	"the Empire State building faced many problems.To dock a dirigible, It needed a good/safe dock site. Also, the wind so high up would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because It was extremely Flammable."	2	2		2																					
15337	6	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were urealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; for in dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas.In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]. ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock.

However, after the modifications were made, the builders had to face another set of obstacles, more serious than before. the first one was ""safety"": the destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised fear for a densely populated area such as New York.

Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships use hydrogen, and extremely flammable gas. In fields, they use lead weights to weight down. If an accident happened with either it would be extremely fatal.

""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street.""

The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost."	3	3		3

However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than down the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have a airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to become reality."	4	4		4

I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with.

The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell.

In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed.

16006	6	"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today."	2	3		3

Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the buildings frame had to be strengthened and reinforced, which was painstaking and expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning."	4	4		4

For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight.

Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around.

15067	6	There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock. For one the Empire State building natural structure can't handle its weight. Therefor architects had to make a stainless steel tower. Even after this was made they realized how flamable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that the airwaves at the top of that building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten about due to the possible accidents that could happen.	2	2		2																					
16093	6	"The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.

Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework.""Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock. As well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law.

16230	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place."	3	3		3																					
14864	6	"While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstactles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the buldings framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with. "	3	4		4

Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast."	3	2		3

Another obstacle they faced was to weigh it down, they'd have to use lead weight but it wouldnt be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in @LOCATION1 on the Street. Overall The architecs faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, Most being either practical or not safe."	2	2		2																					
16018	6	"Based on the information I just read the obstacles the builders had of the empire building, was to find a way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms that have been never opened to public and is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock but they didnt know how to. The builders faced was the city didnt want ""dirigibles to moor at the empire state building because the law agianst airships flying to low over urban areas. They also had complications the captain of the dirigibles shell could not let go of the control levers. The sharp spires of other buildings could pop the dirigibles. The wind was also a problem as it could take the dirigibles a different dirrection."	3	2		3																					
16266	6	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began there work in designing it, they did not take into account the @CAPS1 that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other @CAPS1 included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident @CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"""	2	3		3

To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up.

16334	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle in building a dock for dirigibles. One of the problems they faced was that the did not have suitable landing area. In paragraph six it said that it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours. Also they had realized that most dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen insted of helium which was more highly flammable. In paragraph thirteen they said that an accident could have been worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."	2	2		2																					
16561	6	"Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible."	3	3		3																					
15174	6	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured."	2	3		3																					
14898	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the winds were constantly changing because of the air currents. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock on the empire state building was because many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used Hydrogen which is very flammable. So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey more people would be effected by it. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they could use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp poped then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas. Those with the obstacles the builders could never overcome."	4	4		4

Unfortunetly, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong."	3	3		3																					
15425	6	"The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished."	2	3		3																					
16279	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles that had to be faced was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the united states. The hydrogen was very flamable and the would not be able to stand a fire in such a high populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The winds from nature would make it hard to control the dirigible so people were afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. Those were some of the obstacles that were faced."	3	2		3																					
15899	6	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
15366	6	"many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

15783	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas.

15914	6	"When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose."	3	2		3																					
15052	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration."	3	3		3																					
16225	6	"The obstacles the builders faced building the Empire State Building were; the safety, the time.The safety of building the top the Empire State Building got in the way because, it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. Another reason why it was unsafe because if some of the glass or steel part got pushed off the people down be low. Another reason is the blinps flying to close to the buildings and hitting one of them. Also the passengers going on and off of the blinp; they needed to find away that the passengers wouldn't get hurt.The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough. ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now."""	1	1		1																					
15502	6	"The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use."	3	3		3																					
16202	6	"Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons."	3	3		3																					
15856	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked."	3	3		3																					
15430	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	4		4																					
16141	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there."	1	1		1																					
14844	6	"The Empire State Building's docking zone was a magnificent and novel idea when it was first concieved but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who spearheaded the operation, was too over anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was devoted to researching the risk's and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it on top the Empire State Building was already a failure.       Before the construction even began, trouble started to brew. The building couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transmitted tremendous pressure to the foundation. So the roof would have to be re-done in order for it to be structurally sound. After many months and @NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing dock could begin.       Life is precious, and the landing dock was too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely Flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen caught aflame and killed hundreds. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and showy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles that faced the docking station were too much, so finally the plan to erect it was abandoned."	3	3		3

If something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire. The fire could destroy New York City since it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast.

Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful."	2	2		2

In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside.

A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted."	3	3		3																					
16416	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage."	3	4		4																					
15682	6	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety.

Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""...

Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building.

In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg"	2	2		2																					
16369	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's weight was held by a single cable tether that ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was far below. If the cable tether were to ever break, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" for the winds they the top of the building. These currents would cause docking to potentially be too time-consuming and dangerous. The builders and architects try to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" This was ""neither practical or safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians. The builders and architects of this grand project had to quarrel with many gargantuan obstacles in order to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16101	6	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."	2	3		3																					
15752	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
16515	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building the architects had to take the height.. of the building and mooring mast into account.

An extremely large dirigible board at the top of the building would ""add stress to the buildings frame"".

This would cause stress on the building, so the "steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened." Another obstacle the architects faced was a concern of safety. In the excerpt it says, "Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @CAPS1 the greatest obstacle was "nature itself." On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents.

15344	6	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe."	3	3		3																					
16050	6	"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.

Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.

They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area.

In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible.

16017	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible."	3	3		3																					
15981	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM3).

16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3

The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles.  The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.  The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air.  This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off.  Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City."	3	3		3																					
15854	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the creation of The Mooring Mast, and its purpose to extending the height of the Empire State Building. Although during the 1930's the concern of the Mooring Mast serving as a docking area for drigibles, also known as today as blimps. After the 85th floor frame was built and the skeleton of the mast of steel and stainless steel glass windows, issues concerning the landing drigibles arose within the public.There were @NUM1 major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never really completed. One reason was because of safety. The excerpt explains how dirigibles from outside of U.S used hydrogen instead of helium. And, using hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German diriglie Hindenburg being destroyed b/c it was on fire in @LOCATION1.Second reason was the problem of wind currents. Winds were extremely violent. Dirigibles would move and sway alot b/c of the strong winds. And the moving dirigibles being that they were at least @DATE2 ft long dangled high above urban areas which wasn't safe at all for people walking under it.Thirdly was the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people.

The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
15447	6	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (paragraph @NUM2)."	4	3		4																					
15234	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people.

This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
14971	6	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on.

After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"".

15093	6	"allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. There were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. The helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. If there was the smallest spark the entire Dirigible would go up in flames in a second. For an example The hindenburg German zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York it would of been much worse.Another problem with the dirigibles was wind. If there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. aqlso it is weighed down by the lead by lead weights.

16588	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."	4	4		4																					
16012	6	"In the construction of the Empire State building the @CAPS1 faced plenty of problems before and after the making of the mast. There were laws preventing the docking of the dirigibles, incidents that had occured, and flaws in safety. The first problem they should have turned their attention to was the law against low-flying aircraft over urban areas. It is said that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another problem faced was the burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. used helium to keep their dirigibles afloat while other countries were using highly-flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @CAPS1 eiven started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was how un-safe it was to have a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo would send the dirigible out of control in these winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It would never make it from the start."	3	3		3

16390	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."	4	4		4																					
15495	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City."	4	4		4

Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors.

Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds.

A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York.

The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe."	3	3		3

Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock.

15042	6	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was laden with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the time of frequent dirigible travel in the world, a German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with fire. This catastrophe revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign dirigibles were inflated with flamable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like the Hindenburg ocuring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also overlooked the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the empire state building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon to be created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs had occured to try out the new mooring system it was seen that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this variety of problems put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building"	4	4		4																					
16157	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible."	3	3		3																					
15511	6	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.	3	2		3																					
15324	6	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First having something this big land on a @NUM1 foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame. All of this stress have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building which was unthoughtof. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was alot concidering every thing elsethat they were doing.

16523	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come @CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock.

16182	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

14943	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realized that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had problem on its own anyways. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacle was ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because it used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to be using these at the Empire State Building. Another thing builders should have considered was that there was a law in place already that is ""...against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other then helium.

A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame.""

15223	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications.

When four-term governor, Al Smith, wanted  to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns. Along with the people whom were constructing the building. These concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction.If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the projectOverall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began."	3	2		3

According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."	3	4		4

Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area."	2	3		3

Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."""	3	4		4

The wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. The other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. @PERSON1 said, ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" @CAPS1 two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver there cargo safetly, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain mooring equipment, which should've been installed.

The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area.

This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top.

The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature.

First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it.

In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building.

Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3		3																					
15648	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station.A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable.

With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer.

To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2).""

One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted it larger and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building.

This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans.

The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas.

The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below."	2	2		2

The idea failed parially due to the impracticality of docking a @DATE2 foot balloon filled with flamable gas to a city building. The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg.

According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this they would be dangling high above pedestrians. Example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

16213	6	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" @CAPS1 so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a drigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened."	2	1		2																					
15013	6	In the excerpt the builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. They found that they couldn't do that because the winds would push the dirigibles in all different dirrections. And also there was a law that air crafts had to be a certain height in the air.	2	1		2																					
15499	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	4	3		4																					
15129	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while building it One obstacle they hit was the dirigibles couldnt dock there because of no mooring mast When the architects and engineers built the building they put a flat roof which the Mooring Mast could not be placed on. They said that the frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to fix the situation. Another obstacle was they couldnt have a Rope holding the Mooring Mast up because the dirigibles wouldnt hold it up. Those are some obstacles the architechs went threw.	2	1		2																					
15986	6	"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."""	1	2		2																					
16253	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high the wind is always switching directions which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". The builders of the Empire State Building also came across ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical or legal."	3	3		3																					
15817	6	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16394	6	"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This promblem would make the dirigibles Swivel around in the air. Another obstacle is that the dirigibles had is that it uses hydrogen and Helium which is highly flammable."	2	2		2																					
16303	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, annanced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used."	3	4		4																					
15950	6	"The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have way too much stress forced on the foundation when it docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the dirigible. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project."	3	3		3																					
15759	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16404	6	"The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal."	3	3		3

15493	6	"In trying to build dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles.

16318	6	"In the 1920s, dirigibles were considered to be the future of transportation. Although useful, dirigibles had an issue, there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
15877	6	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" @CAPS1 starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it. All of these obstacles were faced by the builders of the mooring mast, which eventually led to the disregarding of the idea of using the mooring mast for ships."	3	3		3																					
15358	6	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area."	4	3		4																					
15962	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself."	2	1		2																					
15260	6	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking.  The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space.  There was also the problem of winds.  The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock.  The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible.If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage.  The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building.  It could end up like the hindenburge.	2	2		2																					
15942	6	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. Used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced my obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2		2																					
15261	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

15700	6	"While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.

The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close."	4	4		4

The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous.

""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.

If the did build the dirigible dock, the would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is Flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.

15507	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings.

15373	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""	3	4		4																					
15900	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire on the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it. Those three factors made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe."""	3	3		3																					
16625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York."	2	2		2																					
15311	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16041	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attemply to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in @ORGANIZATION2 but, although adding space for landing The height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the @LOCATION2. -(Which would cost over @MONEY1) the Idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a @ORGANIZATION1 - they realized how dangerous that could be above densely populated area like New York City."	2	2		2																					
16295	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building. Drigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building would let drigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service. But, the stress of the drigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the buildings Foundation. This cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. In May 6, 1937 when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey the builders realized how catastrofick it would have been taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make drigibles not allowed to moor at the Empire State Building. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building."	4	3		4																					
15488	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with."	3	3		3																					
16210	6	"The biggest obsticle was safely. The foriegn dirigibles use Hydrogen (@NUM1) gas as a means to fly but hydrogen gas is highly flamable. The owners of the Empire State Building were consernd because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst, @LOCATION2. The Hindenburg bursted into flames and in less than one minute there was no dirigible, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities."	1	1		1																					
16174	6	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."	2	2		2																					
16510	6	"In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars.

The first problem they encountered was that when moored at the top of the building the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the empire state building to this new situation."" Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen it would be highly flammable. The builders didnt want an ""accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Lastly builders would have to face the obstacle of Nature. With winds so strong up top the building the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in back with lead weights which would be neither safe nor practical dangling high above pedestrians in New York City.

They also had to deal with the electrical  problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly.

15898	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1 line @NUM2) because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter then air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass."	3	3		3																					
15744	6	"Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
15070	6	"When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked."	3	3		3																					
16260	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L�sted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders."	4	3		4																					
15625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low."	2	2		2																					
16621	6	"The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. "	2	3		3																					
16378	6	"The obstacles the buildes of the empire state building faced were that they had to make it strong. Also they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when it landed. they also had to care ful that the dirigbles would crash in to the building when it was droping off the papers. An other obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles would not be able to land easily. Finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and working."	1	1		1																					
15696	6	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."	2	2		2

According to the excerpt, the author says ""The greatest reason was one of safety"". The dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flameable and they could not risk it in such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents"" This created another safety problem. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians.

If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor.

How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.

16029	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles."	4	4		4

Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems.

""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3		3

16108	6	"In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians."	3	2		3

The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City"	3	3		3																					
16429	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.' This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area. The idea of docking dirigibles at the empire state building were ignored."	4	3		3																					
15802	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced a lot of obstacles attempting dirigibles to dock their. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also realize that the dirigibles are flamable and if something were to go wrong it would cause a devestation to a such populated area. These obstacles put and end to the dream of having mooring mast on top of the Empire state building.	3	3		3																					
16352	6	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al @ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 would be constructed to dock drigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the @ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is that the higher altitude @CAPS1 get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) @CAPS1 will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City, if there were any mistakes a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the @DATE1's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society."	3	1		3																					
15245	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.

15407	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of those obstacles was that there was a lack of suitable landing area in New York City. Another obstacle was that the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. Wind on top of the building shift constantly caused by violent air currents. The back of the ship with swivel around the mooring mast while it was tethered."	2	2		2																					
15975	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
16290	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned the idea."	2	3		3																					
15484	6	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin."	3	4		4																					
15291	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ended up with big obstacles in reaching that goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, the workers had to modify the frame or otherwise ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The mooring mast goal was really starting to be dowstable when one problem wasn't realized. Safty, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flamable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights, but using them at the Empire State building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor Safe""."	3	3		3																					
15871	6	"Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them."	2	3		3																					
16475	6	"When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the begining. Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground. With those @CAPS1 being some of the most obvious problems some would think they wouldn't have attempted it but those obsticles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused."	3	2		3																					
14850	6	"In Marcia Amidon L�sted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many obstacles had the engineers of the Empire state building looking for a new way to dock dirigibles. One obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The pressure of the wind and the dirigibles load had cost the company @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be for baggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be very durable so special materials were needed to be brought in and used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building."	1	1		1																					
15360	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. L�sted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15995	6	"In the exerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock.

In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe way to attach it. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to strength and modified the building because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundren feet below.""

One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3).

""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe.

They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15012	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16081	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire state. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph @NUM1, L�sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was for the better that they decided against it."	3	3		3																					
15187	6	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of save entirence. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety."	3	2		3																					
15379	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	3		3																					
14969	6	"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen."	2	2		2																					
16035	6	"In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @NUM1 main obstacles the builders faced where, hydrogen being highly flammable. The second main reason was winds from nature itself. The last reason was the law against airships.The first main obstacle the builders were faced with was there was hydrogen and helium in the balloon and the hydrogen was highly flammable, so the builders needed to make a safe place for the dirigibles to dock. The second main obstacle the builders were faced with was nature itself. The winds from on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

16059	6	The firsts obstacles was to make the Empire State building the worlds tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller. And second obstacle was to drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State building's flat roof.	1	1		1																					
16106	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16525	6	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing it's gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
16620	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building but, you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for it's original purpose. The Mooring Mast was planned to be used as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these is because places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states ""Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable."" (� @NUM1) @CAPS1 they did not a huge fire in a highly populated area. Another reason why it would not work was violent air currents. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be wirled around the mooring mast."" (� @NUM2) @CAPS1 with that problem they would have to worry about the mast being taken out. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt states ""an existing law against airships flying too lower over urban areas"" (� @NUM3) The building mast was to close to humans to let them dock there. @CAPS1 while the mast was a brilliant idea it could not be done now it is only a dream."	4	3		4																					
16467	6	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.	2	2		2																					
15833	6	"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and the dirigibles would be able to take the mooring mast up to the top of the building. The architects found out that if they put the mooring mast on the top of the building its gonna bring stress to the building's foundation."	1	1		1																					
15550	6	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work."	3	3		3																					
16033	6	"The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float.The lack of land area was a problem because ""...some [dirigibles] were as long as @NUM1 ft., The same length as four blocks in @ORGANIZATION2."" This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York, people could be in danger of having large objects flying to and fro, so close to the ground. It would also obscure light.                                                                                                          The wind currents were a factor because 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, which would be a danger to the buildings frame. ""...the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation."" The final obstacle would be the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like @ORGANIZATION2. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York."""	3	4		4																					
15563	6	"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles."	1	1		1																					
16278	6	"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" @CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end there were too many obstacles so the dirigible docking plan was scrapped."	4	3		4																					
16455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3		3																					
15667	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. L�sted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. L�sted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: L�sted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles."	3	3		3
